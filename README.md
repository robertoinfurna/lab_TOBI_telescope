IC 5146, also known as the Cocoon Nebula, is a Galactic HII region ionized by the single B0 V star BD +46°3474. This emission
nebula is embedded within a larger molecular cloud, suggesting a significant presence of dust. We investigated dust extinction
using three independent diagnostic methods. First, Balmer decrements provide a direct estimate of 𝐸 (𝐵 − 𝑉) by comparing the
observed 𝐻𝛼/𝐻 𝛽 surface brightness ratio with the standard intrinsic value of 2.86. Second, we analyzed GAIA BP/RP spectra
of five stars within the nebula, including the central ionizing star, by fitting a blackbody model with extinction to determine dust
absorption. Lastly, we examined the theoretical Strömgren radius for different dust fractions to infer dust constraints indirectly.
Our results confirm the presence of dust within the HII region, though it is not uniformly distributed. Most of the nebula exhibits
low extinction (𝐸 (𝐵 − 𝑉) ≲ 0.3), with localized regions experiencing higher attenuation. The extinction inferred from stellar
spectra favors the Calzetti extinction law over the Cardelli law. While the 𝐸 (𝐵 − 𝑉) values derived from stellar spectra and
Balmer decrements are of the same order of magnitude, they do not show perfect agreement. The Strömgren radius analysis
confirmed the presence of dust in the HII region; however, it did not provide a more precise constraint on the reddening.
